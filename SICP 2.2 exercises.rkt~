;Use this (dotted tail) notation to write a procedure same-parity that
;takes one or more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same even-odd parity as the first
;argument. For example,
;(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;(1 3 5 7)
;(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;(2 4 6)

(define (same-parity x . y) ;car/cdr recursion because I feel like it
  (define (selector input pred)
    (cond ((null? input) '()) ;exit clause
          ((pred (car input)) (cons (car input) (selector (cdr input) pred))) ;pred car input so that it checks for the first one
          (else (selector (cdr input) pred))))

      (cons x (selector y odd?))))

;Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first squarelist procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (square-list2 items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items '()))

;reverse order results because you add to the left with cons (pairs), and because it goes from left to right in the list, it will take the first, put it onto the left, and subsequent elements will be inserted to the left of the first element.
(define (square-list3 items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items '()))
; this just makes a dotted pair every time because you're inserting the answer, a list, to a non-list, which creates a pair represented by a dot. At least it's in the right order?

;Exercise 2.23: the procedure for-each is similar to map. It
;takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results, for-each just
;applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from
;left to right. the values returned by applying the procedure
;to the elements are not used at allâ€”for-each is used with
;procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,
;(for-each (lambda (x)
 ;           (newline)
  ;          (display x))
   ;       (list 57 321 88))
;57
;321
;88

(define (for-each1 function lyst) ; do some recursive procedure to guarantee that the thing does not process
  (function (car lyst)) ;scheme ig just decides that it will go thru everything in parentheses in define
  (cond ((= (length lyst) 2) (function (cadr lyst)))
        (else (for-each1 function (cdr lyst))))) ;why does putting 2 processes in a define work?
(for-each1 (lambda (x)
            (newline)
            (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
