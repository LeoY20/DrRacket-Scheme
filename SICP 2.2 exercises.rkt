;Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first squarelist procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (square-list2 items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items '()))

;reverse order results because you add to the left with cons (pairs), and because it goes from left to right in the list, it will take the first, put it onto the left, and subsequent elements will be inserted to the left of the first element.
(define (square-list3 items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items '()))
; this just makes a dotted pair every time because you're inserting the answer, a list, to a non-list, which creates a pair represented by a dot. At least it's in the right order?

;Exercise 2.23: the procedure for-each is similar to map. It
;takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results, for-each just
;applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from
;left to right. the values returned by applying the procedure
;to the elements are not used at allâ€”for-each is used with
;procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,
;(for-each (lambda (x)
 ;           (newline)
  ;          (display x))
   ;       (list 57 321 88))
;57
;321
;88

(define (for-each1 function lyst) ; do some recursive procedure to guarantee that the thing does not process
  (function (car lyst)) ;scheme ig just decides that it will go thru everything in parentheses in define
  (cond ((= (length lyst) 2) (function (cadr lyst)))
        (else (for-each1 function (cdr lyst))))) ;why does putting 2 processes in a define work?
(for-each1 (lambda (x)
            (newline)
            (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))

;Exercise 2.25: Give combinations of cars and cdrs that

;Exercise 2.27: Modify your reverse procedure of Exercise
;2.18 to produce a deep-reverse procedure that takes a list

          (else (list-iter lyst1 (append result (list (list-ref lyst1 counter))) (- counter 1)))))
  (list-iter lyst '() (- (length lyst) 1)))
